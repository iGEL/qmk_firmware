## iGEL's workman interpretation

This is my ErgoDox interpretation of the
(Workman layout)[http://www.workmanlayout.com/blog/]. It has a symbol layer
with VIM movement buttons (H, J, K, L) and features German umlauts[^1] even
though it's supposed to be used with US-Qwerty settings. They type RAlt + U and
then `a` for ä etc.

The symbol layer is activated by holding innermost key in the bottom line of
either half. I really love it, that's why I gave it such a prominent position.
It also has a QWERTY layer, so you could play games or let your friends try
your weird keyboard.

[^1]: Not yet working :'(

### Changelog
#### 2016-04-17

* Put `~L3` on the outer positions on the bottom row on both halves (previous
  Gui).
* Changed the layout of the three innermost keys on each half. I sometimes
  accidentally hit `L1` and `L3` switches. `L1`, which I almost never use,
  is now on the top row and `L3` was removed here altogether, cause I've added
  the `~L3` and there is already a `L3`. `←` & `→` are now on the bottom row,
  because I actually intend to use them. `Hyper` moved to the middle, and I
  filled the free positions with `Meh` & `Esc`.

#### 2016-04-12

I ported my [old layout](https://github.com/iGEL/ergodox-firmware) over to the
qmt firmware and applied these changes:

* The middle big key on the left thumb cluster now triggers ESC when tapped.
  When hold down, it still triggers LGui.
* Cursor keys are now split between both halves. Left/right are now on the left
  side, up/down still on the right. I always confused them, hopefully this is
  easier to type.  Ü and ß moved to the right half because of that.
* Most positions on the symbol layer changed. All three bracket types are now on
  the left half, in column 3 & 4, like with the original ErgoDox EZ layout. Most
  symbols are rearranged because of that, but I kept the VIM movement row (right
  home row)
* Added the media layer, with working sound buttons :D
* Some of the keys I never used changed (in the middle)

* Not yet working: German umlauts and the Euro sign
